# Machine-Learning

School Final Project - Machine Learning

Tasked with finding out the reasons behind customer churn (when a customer stops using them as the main bank) and to predict customer churn. The goal is to understand why customer churn, and how it varies across different countries, ages, credit scores, etc through visualization, but also pick and create new predictors that will optimize our classification model.
